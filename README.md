# Adventure Game Demo

Demo of a text adventure game in JavaScript. This is not a playable
gameâ€”it's more of a tech demo.

Features:

* Flexbox layout
* Promise-based input
* JavaScript Modules
* Really bad parser
* Perfect for people with low expectations

## Running

Clone it.

CORS won't let this run with a `file://` URL. Run a webserver in the
project directory with:

```
python3 -m http.server 3490
```

Then hit [localhost:3490](http://localhost:3490) in a browser.

## TODO

Set up a live demo.
